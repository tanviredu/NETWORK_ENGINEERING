WHAT IS FILESYSTEM?

	FILESYSTEM IS A METHOD THAT IS USED BY AN OS TO STORE, RETIEVE ORGANIZE AND MANAGE FILES AND DIRECTORIES ON MASS STORAGE DEVICE.

	STORAGE DEVICE > FILE SYSTEM

	FILESYSTEM HOLDS
		1) INFORMATION, DATEOF CREATION AND MODIFICATION
		   OF INDIVIDUAL FILES, FILE SIZAE, FILE TYPE, FILE PERMISSION

		2) PROVIDE STRUCTURED FROM FOR DATA STORAGE

	FILE SYSTEM LABELS ASSIGNED FOR EASY IDENTIFICATION. LABEL MAY BE UP TO 16 CHARACTER LONG AND CAN BE DISPLAYED OR CHANGED USING 

	=>e2label 
	
	OR
	
	=>tune2fs -L

	COMMAND



	FILE SYSTEM EXT4 THE NEWEST FILE SYSTEM FOR LINUX DISTRINUTION BACKWARDS COMPATABLE FOR EXT3 AND EXT2
	EXT4 SUPPORTS JOUIRNALING. SUPPORT VOLUME UP TO 1 EXABYTE AND FILES UP TO 16 TIB, EXT4 IS THE DEFAULT FILE SYSTEM FOR CENTOS/RTEDHAT7 AND UBUNTU

	SWAP IS NOT A TRUE FILE SYSTEM. BUT RATHER A PORTION OF THE HARD DISK THAT IS USED IN SITUATION WHEN LINUX IS OUR OF RAM SPACE AND NEEDS MORE OF IT. LINUX THEN PUSHES SOME UNUSED FILES TO SWAP SPACE TO FREE MEMORY
	THIS TYPE OF OPERATION IS SLOWER.


	PARTITIONS

		A PARTITION IS A SECTION OF THE HARD DISK THAT IS LOGICALLY ACTS AS S SEPARATE DISK. PARTITION CONVERT A LARGE HARD DISK TO SMALLER ,MANAGABLE CHUNKS, LEADING TO BETTER ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION. a PARTITION MUST BE FORMATTED AND ASSIGNED A FILESYSTEM BEFORE DATA CAN BE STORED.
		PARTITION ARE IDENTIFIED USING PARTITION TABLE, WHICH IS STORED IN THE BOOT RECORD.
		PARTITION CAN HAVE FOUR PROIMARY POARTITION

	HARD DISK SECFICATION


	/      MINIMUM 1 GB
	
	/BOOT  100MD
	
	SWAP   DOUBLE OF THE RAM SIZE
	
	/VAR   MINIMUM 250MB. DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE 		SOFTWARE YOU WANT TO INSTALL

	/HOME VARIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF USER


	PARITTION TYPE

	PRIMARY      FOUR PRIMARY PARTITION IS ALLOWED. ONE 			 PARTITION CAN CONTAIN ONE FILE SYSTEM 				 AND IT IS CALLED AS VOLUMES



	EXTENDED 	 AN EXTENDED PARTITION CAN CONTAIN 					 SEVERAL FILESYSTEM. WHICH ARE REFER TO 			 AS LOGICAL FILE SYSTEM. THERE CAN BE ONE 			   EXTENDED PARTITION WHICH IS FURTHER      SUBDIVIDED.  THIS IS A CONTAINER OF 				 			  LOGICAL PARTITION SO IT DOES NOT DIRECTLY 				HOLD ANY DATA. 


	LOGICAL      LOGICAL PARTITION IS CREATED WITHIN AN EXTENDED PARTITION. THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON THE NUMBER OF LOGICAL PARTITION. BUT IS IS ADVISABLE TO LIMIT TO 12 LOGICAL PARTITION PER DISK DRIVE

EVERYTHING IN LINUX IS A FILE


	MOUNT POINTS:
		A MOUNT POINT IS AN ACCESS POINT TO INFORMATION STORED ON A LOCAL OR REMOTE STORAGE DEVICES. THE MOUNT POINT IS TYPICALLY AN EMPTY DIRECTORY ON WHICH A FILESYSTEM IS LOADED, OR MOUNTED. IF THE DIRECTIORY ALREADY HAS CONTENT. THE CONTENT BECOME INVISIBLE TO USERS UNTILL TRHE MOUNTED FILESYSTEM IS UNMOUNTED.

	YOU CAN USE /ETC/FSTAB FILE TO MOUNT FILESYSTEM ON BOOT TIME
